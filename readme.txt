This plugin adds a "YouTube Media" tab to your video upload options.  View and insert your youtube videos without leaving wordpress to find the ID's!

== Description ==

This plugin adds a "YouTube Media" tab to your video upload options.  This allows you to view your YouTube video options and insert the selected video into your posts or pages without having to leave your blog to find the "id" of your video on youtube.

This plugin depends on the Zend Gdata Framework plugin as the Zend GData Api is required as an external dependency.  You can find the Zend Gdata Framework plugin [here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/zend-gdata-interfaces/ "Zend Gdata Framework").

The current version has been tested with the Zend Gdata Framework plugin version 1.10.5.

== Installation ==

1. Upload and install the "Zend GData Framework" plugin first
2. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Configure the YouTube account in the YouTube Media tab under "Settings"
